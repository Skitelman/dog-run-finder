# Dog Run Finder

This is a little command line app that tries to find the closest dog run to a given address. It uses the [NYC OpenData DogRun API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Directory-of-Dog-Runs-and-Off-Leash-Areas/ipbu-mtcs). The dataset is fairly incomplete so the app doesn't work super well. Any improvements or suggestions are welcome.
